A very simple plugin to house theme (or plugin) customisations. Think of this as an alternative to adding code snippets to the functions.php, or custom.css file in your parent theme. Why? It keeps all of your changes in one location, independent of the other components that make up your web site. That means you can safely perform theme / plugin updates without the worry of losing your modifications.

"But isn't that what child themes are for?" Well, kind of. Sure, you can put your modifications in a child theme, but there are many places (including woothemes.com and wordpress.org) to download and use child themes. If you decide to use a child theme built by a third party and still make modifications, you wont want to touch any of the files therein. Instead, use this plugin.

In fact, it's arguable that you're better off using this plugin regardless of whether you're using a child theme or a parent theme. Imagine you're using a parent theme, but then you notice a child theme released for it that you love and want to use. Well, you can't, because you already created a child theme for your modifications. Sad Panda. So yeah, keep your modifications in a plugin and your wildest dreams will come true.

== Usage ==

* Add any CSS snippets to `custom/style.css`.
* Add any PHP snippets to `custom/functions.php`.
* Activate the plugin.

Simple!
